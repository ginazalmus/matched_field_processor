# acoustic imaging with matched-field processors
acoustic imaging with matched-field processors (linear processor and minimum variance distortionless response)

repository includes COMSOL simulation files and MATLAB scripts for two different matched-field processors: the linear (bartlett's) processor and the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) for acoustic imaging purposes.

detailed explanations will come soon (the below thesis can be checked for more information)
